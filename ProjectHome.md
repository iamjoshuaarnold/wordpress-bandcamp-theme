# Introduction #
The Wordpress Bandcamp theme allows self hosted WordPress and WordPressMU blog owners to automatically style their blog to match their custom Bandcamp layout by only entering their Bandcamp Domain Name into the themes admin page.

**Message to Bandcamp:**
> I have noticed that other bands are styling their own websites/blogs to match their Bandcamp layout and have had an Idea to create a WordPress theme that could do just that.

> So here are some questions and ideas I have

  1. If I was to indeed create a Wordpress theme, it would be under Wordpress' guidelines stating it is GPL'd - and as such - it would be hosted on a publically accessable SVN service with Trak and all the usual support tools ready for anyone with a WordPress (or WordPressMU) self hosted blog.
  1. The theme would also state that it is not affiliated with Bandcamp and Bandcamp have no responsibility for the theme.
  1. The theme will provide an admin menu for the user to enter their Bandcamp URL while still enabling them to use WordPress Widgets and Plugins as a standard theme would.
  1. What are your views on usage of the users CSS by scraping or indeed similar layout styling?

**Message from Bandcamp:**
> Go for it!

## Why? ##
Musicians love what they do and Bandcamp provide a great service, so we aim to provide a theme for Musicians to use on the WordPress blogging platform. Musicians only then need to worry about styling their Bandcamp theme, writing the occasional blog post ...and most importantly - Writing Music!

## Requirements ##
  * PHP5 (sorry if you use PHP4 - you could always Get Involved)
  * Self hosted WordPress blog (or WordPressMU with access to 'Site Admin - Themes')
  * Your Bandcamp URL
